This is an interface for a traverseable maze.

This interface asssumes you have a maze class which implements it.
The maze class should hold the map to the maze, which should be created in its constructor.
The maze is then traversed through in your main method.

In case anyone has any feedback to the interface, it was hastily put together,
feel free to reach me on the CompSci Discord or over university email. zp235@exeter.ac.uk

Also let me know about your creations! I'm curious how my MazeSolving algorithm performs in your mazes, and vica versa!
If there's enough interest we can make a league which algorithm requires the least steps to solve a particular maze algorithm.
